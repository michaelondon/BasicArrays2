# BasicArrays2
Create an array that can hold ten integers. Fill up each slot of the array with a random number from 1 to 100. Then display the contents of the array on the screen. You must use a loop.
And, like last time, you must use the length field of your array and not a literal number (like 10) in the condition of the loop.
